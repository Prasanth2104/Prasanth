1. Suppose Dr. Copper urgently need to report some newly discovered prime numbers and you would help to send the data from one of the computers in Lee's Summit campus to a server in Warrensburg campus. The computer is connected with a 100BASE-TX Ethernet over twisted pair. The size of data is so large that we need 1000 single-sided DVDs to store all numbers. Dr. Silver suggests you sending all the data completely through the network. Dr. Gold suggests you sending all DVDs by using UPS ground transportation service. Further, we suppose all the data are already stored in that one single machine and all DVDs are already burned with data. If the only factor we consider is time, who would you agree with, Dr. Silver or Dr. Gold? Define all necessary terms, make proper assumptions, and justify your answer.

2. If you want to do a transaction from a remote client to a server, which type of protocol would you use, TCP or UDP? Why? Please provide details with your assumed situations.

3. Is it technically possible for a professor in the department to know where his students sent the email, if (1) they are using with an .edu email address? (2) they are using the email address such as @yahoo.com or @hotmail.com ? Why? (Note: Your answer will be graded based on correctness and analytical process, not the number of words.)
